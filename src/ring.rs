/// A low-level primitive for building an IO object on io-uring

/// IO events submitted to io-uring, rather than representing a single submission. Because of this,
/// it is more low level, but it is suitable for building an IO object like a `File` on top of
/// io-uring.
///
/// Users writing code on top of `Ring` are responsible for making sure that it is correct. For
/// example, when calling `poll`, users must ensure that they are in the proper state to submit
/// whatever type of IO they would be attempting to submit. Additionally, users should note that
/// `Ring` does not implement `Drop`. In order to cancel any ongoing IO, users are responsible for
/// implementing drop to call cancel properly.
